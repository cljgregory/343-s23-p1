            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Save The Vods, where Super Smash Bros enthusiasts come together to create a community of like-minded individuals. <br>
                We are a group of JMU college students who share a burning passion for gaming and the unique opportunities it offers to connect with others.
                We founded this community in 2020 with the goal of providing an inclusive and welcoming environment where gamers of all skill levels can thrive.
                When we first began this journey, we knew that we wanted to create something truly special. We recognized the need for a platform that was more than just a place to play games - we wanted to build a community that was supportive, collaborative, and inspiring. With that vision in mind, we set out to create a space where players could come together to share their experiences, learn from each other, and push the boundaries of what's possible in a gaming community.</p>
